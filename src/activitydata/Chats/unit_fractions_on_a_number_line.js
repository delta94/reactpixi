    OBJECTIVES: ["Connect area model of fractions to a number line.","Identify the unit 'whole'.","Estimate points on a number line using unit fractions."],
    DESCRIPTION: "Students estimate the location on a number line of unit fractions represented by a circle model. Students connect a circle (a wheel) model of fractions to the number line. Students begin by identifying the unit 'whole' using a circle model, then estimate where a series of unit fractions will land on the number line. The unit 'whole' is represented by the circumference of the wheel, one whole wheel's cricumference is the distance from zero to 1. Students begin by solving puzzles with visual wholes (circle model), then, the prompt goes in symbolic form. Students need to place the basket so JiJi lands on it. Students need to visualize the size of the unit fraction and estimate the location by iterating the distance traveled by each unit fraction.",
