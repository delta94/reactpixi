    OBJECTIVES: ["Develop strategies for comparing fractions."],
    DESCRIPTION: "Students Lookup with the same numerator, e.g. 2/3 and 2/8, or the same denominator, e.g. 3/4 and 2/4, by applying their understanding of unit fractions. When comparing two fractions with like numerators (3/4 and 3/8), students will need to explain that since eighths are smaller than fourths, 3-fourths are greater than 3-eighths. When comparing fractions with like denominators, the problem is more straight forward. 4/6 is greater than 3/6 because you have one more sixth. Students should see these fractions as composed of a set of unit fractions. The visual feedback reinforces this idea. The fractions animate out to bar models so students can see that cutting a whole into eighths creates smaller pieces than do fourths. Since you have 3 of each type, the 3 fourths are greater than the 3 eighths. This lesson culminates the work from the previous lessons in two key ways. 1- It reinforces the idea that a fraction, e.g. 7/8, is composed of a set of unit fractions with that denominator, e.g. 1/8; and, 2-that the larger the denominator, the smaller the unit fraction. The classroom discussion should focus on these two key elements.",
