    OBJECTIVES: ["Locate fractions on a number line using benchmarks.","Compare fractions by using the position of unit fractions."],
    DESCRIPTION: "Students use benchmark fractions 0, 1/2 and 1 to estimate points for other fractions. Students begin by locating benchmark fractions like 1/2, then use that information other points on the number line. For example, after locating 1/2 students can reason that 1/4 is between 0 and 1/2 and that 3/4 is between 1/2 and 1. Students apply their understanding of unit fractions to reason about their location on a number line: 1/8 is closer to 0 than 1/3 since 1/8 is smaller than 1/3. This reasoning is extended to fractions close to 1/2 or 1 whole: 3/8 is close to 1/2 (4/8) and 7/8 is close to 1 (8/8). During the discussion, students should explain their estimates using benchmark numbers and other strategies for locating fractions on the number line.",
